% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Plot the training data into a figure using the 
%               "figure" and "plot" commands. Set the axes labels using
%               the "xlabel" and "ylabel" commands. Assume the 
%               population and revenue data have been passed in
%               as the x and y arguments of this function.
%
% Hint: You can use the 'rx' option with plot to have the markers
%       appear as red crosses. Furthermore, you can make the
%       markers larger by using plot(..., 'rx', 'MarkerSize', 10);
plot(x,y,'rx','MarkerSize',10);        % Plot the data
xlabel('Population of City in 10K');   % Label of X-Axis
ylabel('Profit or Loss in 10K U$D');   % Label of Y-Axis
title('Population vs Profit/Loss Plot');
